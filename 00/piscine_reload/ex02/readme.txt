Here's a complete explanation of the command:

```bash
find . \( -name '*~' -o -name '#*#' \) -exec echo {} \; -exec rm {} +
```

### What the command does:

1. **`find .`**:  
   This part tells `find` to search starting from the current directory (`.`). It will recursively look through all subdirectories as well.

2. **`\(` and `\)`**:  
   The parentheses are used to group conditions. They are escaped with backslashes (`\`) so that the shell doesn't interpret them incorrectly and passes them directly to the `find` command.

3. **`-name '*~'`**:  
   This condition matches any file whose name ends with `~`. Such files are often temporary backup files created by text editors like Vim or Emacs.

4. **`-o`**:  
   This is the logical OR operator. It tells `find` to look for files that match either the first condition (`-name '*~'`) or the second condition (`-name '#*#'`).

5. **`-name '#*#'`**:  
   This condition matches files whose names are surrounded by `#`. These are also often temporary or backup files, frequently created by text editors or during version control operations.

6. **`-exec echo {} \;`**:  
   For each file found by `find`, this part executes the command `echo {}`. The `{}` is a placeholder for the current file name. The `echo` command outputs the file name to the terminal, showing you the files that are being processed. The `\;` at the end is necessary to terminate the `-exec` command and tells `find` to run `echo` for each individual file.

7. **`-exec rm {} +`**:  
   After displaying the file names, this part executes the `rm` command to delete each file. Again, the `{}` is replaced with the name of the file to be removed. The `+` at the end allows `rm` to remove multiple files in a single invocation, making the deletion process more efficient than running `rm` for each file separately.

### Step-by-step process:
1. `find` starts in the current directory (`.`) and looks for files that match either of these conditions:
   - Files ending in `~`
   - Files starting and ending with `#`
2. For each file that matches, `find` first runs `echo` to print the file name to the terminal.
3. After printing the file name, `find` runs `rm` to delete the file.

### Summary:
This command searches for all files in the current directory and its subdirectories that end with `~` or are surrounded by `#`, prints the name of each file to the terminal, and then deletes the file. It allows you to see which files are being deleted, providing a visual confirmation before they are removed.
